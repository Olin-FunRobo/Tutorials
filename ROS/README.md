### Why ROS?

[Source](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Introduction)

ROS is an open-source, meta-operating system for your robot.

It provides the services you would expect from an operating system, including hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management.

It also provides tools and libraries for obtaining, building, writing, and running code across multiple computers.

By doing this, ROS standardizes the protocols, which allows for a modular design that can be almost feel like a plug-and-play experience for developers.
