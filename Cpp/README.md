# C++ Tutorials

## Why C++?

C++ is a language that *augments* C with various new features and libraries.
It retains the performance of C while abstracting out a lot of laborious tasks so that the programmer can concentrate on higher-level development than simply trying to implement something in the correct syntax.

C++ is used everywhere from handling servers to running microcontrollers; as a Roboticist, it is important to communicate with hardware in a lower-level setting.
