# Python to C/C++

In this section, we'll discuss migrating to C/C++ from python backgrounds.

[Here](http://users.aims.ac.za/~nneoma/cpp4py/cpptut.html) is a brief tutorial that explains the differences by comparing C++ and Python implementations of equivalent programs.

[Here](http://www.toves.org/books/cpy) is a slightly shorter web-based tutorial.

[Here](python2cpp.pdf) is a somewhat long pdf-based tutorial for ones who want to master C++.
