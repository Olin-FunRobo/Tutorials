## C/C++ Syntax

### Basics

The first wall when learning C/C++ is compiling and linking to the right libraries and headers, etc., which can be a headache.

That said, it would be even more of an overhead to learn CMake before learning C just to make the compilation simpler.

[Here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm) is a nice tutorial that lets you run C++ codes on an online compiler.

You'll have to know eventually how to do those, but I encourage you to simply explore and enjoy learning the language for now.
