# CLion Tutorials

CLion is an IDE developed by JetBrains for development of C/C++.

Its project structure uses CMake, which is well compatible with ROS.

We decided to use CLion as a standard platform for development this semester,

because it is convenient for newcomers to C/C++, and it is free for students (as of other JetBrains IDEs).

## Installation

1. Check that you have more than 274 MB left in your storage. 

2. Go to [Download URL](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/)

3. Click on the download link.

4. When Download finishes, decompress the archive:

```bash
cd ${Your-Download-Directory}
tar -xvzf CLion-*-.tar.gz
```

If your archive name doesn't match the format above, change the command to match the filename.

5. Launch CLion:

```bash
cd  ${Your-CLion-Directory}/bin
./clion.sh
```

6. Configure CLion (Default is fine)
